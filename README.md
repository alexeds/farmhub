# Farmhub

A place for a city's urban farmers to get together and share resources. A #codeacross project.

## Roadmap

Contributions are encouraged! Here are some ways to get started:

1. Pretty frontend templates (more than basic Bootstrap).
2. Documentation using Sphinx. [http://sphinx-doc.org/](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
3. Search using Solr or Elastisearch.
4. Optional email notifications and daily/weekly digests.
5. Email a user from the interface without revealing user's email address.
6. More social networking type features: "friending" and "favoriting."
